# WK7-Data-Pipelines-with-Python

Project Brief
Telecom companies often have to extract billing data from multiple CSV files generated from
various systems and transform it into a structured format for analysis and revenue reporting.
This process can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hinder decision-making. Manually
analyzing and reconciling billing data from different sources is a tedious task and often leads to
delays in generating revenue reports. Thus, there is a need for an automated data pipeline that
can extract billing data from multiple sources and transform it into a structured format for
efficient analysis and revenue reporting.
